# Fluxbots 2019
gitting with the program (hehehe)

Making a repository for data and code relating to the 2019 Fluxbots project (Caylor and Forbes, Mpala Research Centre, Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment). 

Two folders: 
one containing data (cal/val spreadsheet comparing PP Systems CIRAS SRC-2 manually-collected carbon flux data to data collected at same/similar times with fluxbots; master spreadsheet containing all the raw data collected by the network of fluxbots); 
one containing code (1: to determine the correction factor (if any) to apply to the raw data collected by the fluxbots, determined using the cal/val dataframe, 2: to calculate the flux at each hour collected by each fluxbot, 3: to analyze relationships across fluxbots e.g. between herbivore treatments, across landscape features, through time, in response to rainfall events).
